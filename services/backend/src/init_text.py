Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir,\n
Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;\n
And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,\n
What company, at what expense; and finding\n
By this encompassment and drift of question\n
That they do know my son, come you more nearer\n
Than your particular demands will touch it:\n
Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;\n
As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,\n
And in part him: ' do you mark this, Reynaldo?\n
REYNALDO\n
Ay, very well, my lord.\n
LORD POLONIUS\n
'And in part him; but' you may say 'not well:\n
But, if't be he I mean, he's very wild;\n
Addicted so and so:' and there put on him\n
What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank\n
As may dishonour him; take heed of that;\n
But, sir, such wanton, wild and usual slips\n
As are companions noted and most known\n
To youth and liberty.\n
REYNALDO\n
As gaming, my lord.\n
LORD POLONIUS\n
Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,\n
Drabbing: you may go so far.\n
REYNALDO\n
My lord, that would dishonour him.\n
LORD POLONIUS\n
'Faith, no; as you may season it in the charge\n
You must not put another scandal on him,\n
That he is open to incontinency;\n
That's not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly\n
That they may seem the taints of liberty,\n
The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,\n
A savageness in unreclaimed blood,\n
Of general assault.\n
REYNALDO\n
But, my good lord,--\n
LORD POLONIUS\n
Wherefore should you do this?\n
REYNALDO\n
Ay, my lord,\n
I would know that.\n
LORD POLONIUS\n
Marry, sir, here's my drift;\n
And I believe, it is a fetch of wit:\n
You laying these slight sullies on my son,\n
As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' the working, Mark you,\n
Your party in converse, him you would sound,\n
Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes\n
The youth you breathe of guilty, be assured\n
He closes with you in this consequence;\n
'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman,'\n
According to the phrase or the addition\n
Of man and country."""

Am I like such a fellow?\n
MERCUTIO\n
Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as\n
any in Italy, and as soon moved to be moody, and as\n
soon moody to be moved.\n
BENVOLIO\n
And what to?\n
MERCUTIO\n
Nay, an there were two such, we should have none\n
shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou! why,\n
thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more,\n
or a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast: thou\n
wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no\n
other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes: what\n
eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?\n
Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of\n
meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as\n
an egg for quarrelling: thou hast quarrelled with a\n
man for coughing in the street, because he hath\n
wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun:\n
didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing\n
his new doublet before Easter? with another, for\n
tying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thou\n
wilt tutor me from quarrelling!\n
BENVOLIO\n
An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man\n
should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.\n
MERCUTIO\n
The fee-simple! O simple!\n
BENVOLIO\n
By my head, here come the Capulets.\n
MERCUTIO\n
By my heel, I care not.\n
Enter TYBALT and others\n
\n
TYBALT\n
Follow me close, for I will speak to them.\n
Gentlemen, good den: a word with one of you.\n
MERCUTIO\n
And but one word with one of us? couple it with\n
something; make it a word and a blow.\n
TYBALT\n
You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you\n
will give me occasion.\n
MERCUTIO\n
Could you not take some occasion without giving?\n
TYBALT\n
Mercutio, thou consort'st with Romeo,--\n
MERCUTIO\n
Consort! what, dost thou make us minstrels? an\n
thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but\n
discords: here's my fiddlestick; here's that shall\n
make you dance. 'Zounds, consort!\n
BENVOLIO\n
We talk here in the public haunt of men:\n
Either withdraw unto some private place,\n
And reason coldly of your grievances,\n
Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.\n
MERCUTIO\n
Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze;\n
I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.\n
Enter ROMEO\n
\n
TYBALT
Well, peace be with you, sir: here comes my man.\n
MERCUTIO\n
But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery:\n
Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower;\n
Your worship in that sense may call him 'man.'\n
TYBALT\n
Romeo, the hate I bear thee can afford\n
No better term than this,--thou art a villain."""

segreg = """Residential Segregation 3 greater the degree of residential integration. The actual number tells us what percentage of a city's black population would have to move in order to have no segregation. Their formula for computing the index is based on the proportion of nonwhite households in a given block in relation to the proportion of nonwhites in the city as a whole. The Taeubers found that segregation indexes calculated from block data are somewhat higher than indexes computed from census tract data, but there is a high correlation between the two sets of indexes (Taeu- ber 1965:229). The latest computations of Taeuber’s D show persisting although slightly diminishing segregation in the United States, with mean indexes for 109 cities of 85 in 1940 to 82 in 1970 and 76 in 1988 (Taeuber 1988:38). Where Does Segregation Occur? Because social stratification and minority-majority populations occur in all human societies, it follows that spatial segregation of living quar¬ ters occurs everywhere. We know of no society that does not have housing segregation based on social status differences. This holds true regardless of whether the group comparisons are of whites or blacks, minority or majority, central cities or suburban rings, or European, American, or Third World countries (Schwab 1982:394). What differs from society to society, however, is the extent of segregation, the pattern of segregation, and the specific basis for it. That basis is rooted in the particular history of each society. The concentration or dispersion of different groups in geographical space is found in its most extreme form when groups live in particular regions separated by water barriers. Somewhat less extreme would be regional concentration in continuous land areas. Ethnic regionalism is found in a number of societies such as in Yugoslavia, where 71 percent of the Serbs live in Serbia, 79 percent of Croats live in Croatia, and 94 percent of Slovenes live in Slovenia (Burkey 1978:39)."""
