I used to love a lot of this stuff, but my brain's gotten to the point at this point where I can't say anything, or don't care very much about it at all. I'm on my way to make some kind of "real shit stuff" out of it all by myself instead. I need your help: if you have money to spare, let me know!

P.S... The post about the "re-release" of the CD was pretty quick and pretty funny. Hopefully now I'll find to my old age why this CD is worth waiting on so I can take some shit to get my next fix. And in case you're on the fence about your next album, just drop me a line, and I'll take care of this.

Thank you so much @Ricolphe. I love you.<|endoftext|>AUGUSTA, Minn. -- As the University of Minn's football program works through its second offseason program, it's an important issue to understand as head coach Tim Tebow is forced to confront his old nemesis.

Tebow and head coach Mike Leach are going to need to figure out what to do with a team that missed the playoffs and lost to the Seattle Seahawks on Friday night.

The question is where does a head coach who has failed to win in three-straight games start once again?

When Leach, a five-star quarterback, called a press conference to show his commitment Wednesday morning, he said the Vikings were disappointed and were "pretty disappointed" that they couldn't win the season finale. He said he didn't know about the injuries that plagued Leach and it was an opportunity for him to bring back a guy who had already lost 13 games in a row.

"We're going to have to see how everybody reacts to that," Leach said. "That's a very good concern for me."

He could have a little more patience with the news of Leach making the call without informing his team and the team would see his coaching staff come clean about the fact they were wrong to call a loss and then ask questions.

But instead, he took it personally.

"The coaches and staff there were great guys, great players," Leach said. "I've been so happy for them to be here. I would have loved to take that opportunity to be here and be here here as a student-athlete. I'm sure they're going to be very excited."

The Vikings will have a chance to earn first-team All-SEC honours for the first time in three weeks under Leach and should earn an FBS All-Big Ten nod next season.

They are a team without star running back Adrian Peterson and running back Adrian Peterson will be considered ineligible because of a hamstring injury.

Tebow, who is in his eighth season of playing in the National Football League, had 12 touchdown passes against the Seahawks and two more against the Vikings the previous two years.

He had a similar three-game loss to Seattle last season, when he dropped back to allow two touchdowns against the Seahawks and his three field goals against the Chargers.

Leach said Thursday he will look to do more to ensure the team does not miss the postseason.

"This is going to be hard for my team in the longer run to find that win game that really helped us," Leach said.

In a sign of frustration, the Vikings went 9-8 this season. They lost both of their first two games before the opener against the Seahawks. After the Seahawks lost 10 straight games and lost a final four games during their season, Leach said he was not disappointed the club's players would give up two games.

He said the team has improved since the loss, and the loss of Peterson to hamstring injuries and Peterson to an injury to Adrian Peterson should set a high standard for an offensive line coach for the first time in his career.

"He's a guy that is extremely athletic," Leach said.

"We took this opportunity off the backside of the field a few times. We didn't lose. We beat this guy and then we beat his team that's not our team, but we lost at halftime, because you can't be upset about that. They did play a great game. It was just hard to see them beat them.

"It didn't really change the fact that this team is about winning, even if if we got to the NFC Championship Game. It only really changes things as a team and at the end of the night, we're a team that's made some mistakes.

"We'll figure that out. This is going to be hard for us at home."<|endoftext|>The U.S. Congress voted Wednesday to authorize the military to buy back more than $25 billion in equipment from Iraq.
